The translocationist is a subclass for the Horde gamemode, found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2401598805&searchtext=horde

Teleport to your teleport node if you have it with Shift+E. Create a new one upon teleporting to it. Teleporting deals 250 shock damage in an AOE.
Teleporting also gives 100% evasion for 1 second.
Max HP is reduced to 85
Has access to Sniper Rifles and (planned but not currently) Shotguns.

It has not yet been tested in multiplayer, but it probably works.
Feedback is welcomed.

Horde was updated and now allows subclasses to have custom weapon selections. I will add this to the class so that it works as intended at some point.
